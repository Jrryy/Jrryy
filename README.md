I'm Gerard, Computer Science graduate since 2019.

I've been working on software engineering since 2018, mainly using python. Currently I work for Red Hat in their Learning Platforms team. My mail field has been backend web engineering, but I've worked on all sorts of things, from simple APIs to machine learning recommender systems.
